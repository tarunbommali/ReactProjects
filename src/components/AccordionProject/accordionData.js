/*
An accordion is a graphical user interface (GUI) element commonly
used in web development to manage content in a collapsible and
expandable manner, typically organized in a vertical stack. 
It consists of a series of panels or sections, each containing 
content such as text, images, or other UI elements.
The primary feature of an accordion is its ability to toggle the 
visibility of its panels. Usually, only one panel is expanded (visible) at a time, 
and clicking on the header or title of a closed panel will expand it 
while collapsing any currently open panel. This behavior allows
users to efficiently navigate through the content without overwhelming
them with too much information at once.

Accordions are frequently utilized in websites or applications where space is 
limited or where users need to focus on specific sections of content without
being distracted by unrelated information. 
They are commonly seen in FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) sections, 
product descriptions, navigation menus, and more.
